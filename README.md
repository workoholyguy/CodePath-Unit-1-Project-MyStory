# Project 1 - MyStory

Submitted by: Omar Madjitov

MyStory is an app that introduces the Comic Character whose name is Deadpool. After Launching the application user is able to click one of three buttons. Depending on which button is pushed the application takes the user to a next screen where it displays a certain picture associated with the Information about the charater being provided. Diferent Combinations of the image and text are displayed depending on which button has been clicked. 

Time spent: 9 hours spent in total

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- The Main chalange was the fact that my Mac keeps crashing, and I'm having to reload it, which delayes the process.
- Surprisingly it took me more time than expected to make a picture of the character round. 
- The process of creating a struct and specifying tags took me the longest, bu the result was very rewarding
- Anothe rminor challenge that I had was with displaying the label on multiple lines, beacuse it kept getting cropped, however, it was a very easy fix.    '
